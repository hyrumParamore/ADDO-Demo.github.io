            <p>
                My name is Hyrum Paramore and I am a senior at Brigham Young University - Idaho studying Software Engineering.

            <h2>Introduction</h2> 
            <p>
                For my Senior Project, I decided I wanted to learn to and build an iOS app. Mobile app development is something that I have been interested in for a while now, and being able to take the time required to really step into the world of mobile app development has helped increase that interest and desire to want to learn more and become a better mobile app developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this project, I had very little knowledge of the Swift/SwiftUI language, let alone build an iOS app from basically nothing. Everything you see comes from a lot of hard work, study, TONS of trial and error, and much success! I spent a 14-week semester focused on this project because I wanted to create something amazing! I spend over 200+ hours on the project itself, and many more hours thinking about how to solve problems and make different aspects of the app work. 
            </p>

                    I am proud to share that I excelled in my Senior Project class and achieved a perfect score of 100%. My professor was impressed with my work and gave me high praise, which is evidence of my dedication and hard work.
                </p>
            </div>

        <p>
            Without further ado, I present <span class="header-title">ADDO</span>!

            <h2>The Purpose of this App:</h2>

            <p>
                <!-- Think about this -->
                While the main purpose for this app was to complete my Senior Project class, I also wanted to create something to demonstrate my abilities as a developer, that I work hard, and my dedication to learning something new and delivering something amazing.
            </p>

            <p>    
                The main idea for this app is to help people get tasks done, whether those tasks are for work or for personal projects, the result is aimed to be the same, and that is to complete those tasks!
            </p>

            <p>    
                The difference between this app and many other task-managing apps is that this one limits you in how far out your tasks can be created. In many other apps out there, you could schedule out tasks months or even years out. Not with this app. ADDO only allows you to schedule tasks that are within two weeks from your current day. This means that you will be more focused on getting those tasks done in a timely manner. When I try to use other task managing apps, they seem to be more like planners or calenders, which allow you to schedule out so far in advance that there is no real push for those tasks or projects that you want to get done within two weeks. This app helps you to achieve that and again, complete those tasks in a more efficient way.
            </p>

            <p>    
                One of the main focuses of this app is to help people get stuff done, whether that is for work, everyday tasks around the house, personal projects, etc. Another focus is for those who have endless ideas and projects that they want to keep track of and get done. Providing only two weeks to plan ahead helps to keep you on track, and if you aren't able to complete the task when you want, it is super easy to reschedule for a different day.
            </p>

                I am still in the process of making the official demo video, so in the meantime, check out the features below to see how the app works!
