*My name is Hyrum Paramore and I am a senior at Brigham Young University - Idaho studying Software Engineering.*


## Introduction
For my Senior Project, I decided I wanted to learn to and build an iOS app. iOS app development is something that I have been interested in for a while now and being able to take the time required to really step into the world of mobile app development has helped increase that interest and desire to want to learn more and become a better mobile app developer.


For this project, I had very little knowledge in the Swift/SwiftUI language, let along building an iOS app from basically nothing. Everything you see comes from a lot of hard work, study, TONS of trial and error, and much success! I spent a 14 week semester focused on this project because I wanted to create something amazing! I spend over 200+ hours on the project itself, and many more hours thinking about how to solve problems and make different aspects of the app work. 

*(One thing to note is that I got **100%** in this class! :D)*




Without further ado, I present to you ADDO!
<br></br>

### The Purpose of this App:
The main idea for this app is to help people get tasks done, whether those tasks are for work or for personal projects, the result is aimed to be the same, and that is to complete those tasks!

The difference between this app and many other task managing apps is that this one limits you in how far out your tasks can be created. In many other apps out there, you could schedule out tasks months or even years out. Not with this app. ADDO only allows you to schedule tasks that are within two-weeks from your current day. This means that you will be more focused on getting those tasks done in a timely manner. When I try to use other task managing apps, they seem to be more like planners or calenders, where it allows you to schedule out so far in advance that there is no real push for those tasks or projects that you want to get done within two-weeks. This app helps you to achieve that and again, complete those tasks in a more efficient way.

One of the main focuses of this app is to help people get stuff done, whether that is for work work, everyday tasks around the house, personal projects, etc. Another focus is for those who have endless ideas and projects that they want to keep track of and get done. Providing only two weeks to plan ahead helps to keep you on track, and if you aren't able to complete the task when you wanted, it is super easy to reschedule to a different day.

#### I am still in the process of making the official demo video, so in the meantime, check out the features below to see how the app works!

<!-- Add images/gif's to demo key features that really make the app different. What people would want to see -->
<!-- [Add an image or gif of key features here](link) -->


<!-- ### Some key features to note:
I wanted this app to stand out and be different from any other task managing app out there. While there are still many similarities to other apps like creating tasks and scheduling them to specific days, this one has some little bit different ways to do it that I believe helps with efficiency and leads to an overall great user experience. -->

<!-- These features were some things that I thought important in the development of this app.  -->
<!-- These are considered "must haves" and "stretch goals" for the senior project to be marked as completed and for it to be graded on. *(One thing to note is that I got **100%** in this class! :D )* -->


<!-- * The app is to look pleasing, having a clean and easy to use interface
* It will store the data locally on the device and retain it when user sessions expire (the app gets closed)
* The app will allow users to create tasks and give them titles and assign them to sections, and if desired, allow the user to schedule the tasks to a specific day within two-weeks from the current day.
* The app will allow the user to easily reschedule tasks to a different day.
* The app will have two main pages, a "Planner" page (where time sensitive tasks are stored), and a "Someday" page where tasks that are not time sensitive (meaning not scheduled to a specific day) are stored.
* The app will allow users to see the two week view and be able to tell which day has tasks assigned to it by a small colored dot underneath the date bubble.
* The app will provide dates so that the user is aware of the current date.
* The app will allow users to create and customize (the title, section color, and placement on page) "Sections" where tasks are stored in groups on the different pages (this allows for better organization).
* There will be a settings area to create new sections.
* The app will allow user to delete tasks and sections, and if accidentally done, will allow the user to also undo the delete. -->

### Future features and ideas:
* Allow for a daily reminder for each section (push notifications).
* The app will create a reschedule reminder for those tasks that were not completed to be placed elsewhere.
* Customize the "Planner" page to be more of an hourly schedule rather than just sections that contain tasks for the day.
* Add compatibility to sync with your Google Calendar and create your daily tasks based off of what is on the calendar.
* Add acceptability features for those who require/need them.
* Add the functionality to move sections to the tasks and allow you to move them up and down the section. This should be pretty simple to do, it will just take a bit of time to get it working properly because there are more than two sections.
